# Firebase Unexpected Errors
This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when using the Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore, particularly those related to security rules and data structure mismatches.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides solutions.

## Issues:

1. **Security Rules Violations:**  Incorrectly configured security rules may prevent data access, resulting in runtime exceptions.
2. **Data Structure Mismatches:** Assuming a specific data structure (e.g., expecting an object but receiving an array) may cause unexpected behavior or silent failures.

## Solutions:

1. **Review and Adjust Security Rules:** Ensure your Firebase security rules correctly authorize data access.
2. **Data Validation:** Implement robust input validation to prevent data structure mismatches.
3. **Error Handling:** Employ appropriate error handling to catch and gracefully manage exceptions.
