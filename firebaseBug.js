The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the rules in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore are too restrictive.  For example, if you try to read data that your client's security rules don't allow, you'll get an error.  Another common issue is improperly structured data causing unexpected behavior. For instance, expecting an object but receiving an array, or attempting to access a field that doesn't exist.
